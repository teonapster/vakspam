.#Opinion Spam Detection
The goal of this web application is to make it easier for yelp employees to detect suspicious review activities from users that try to mislead visitors by either giving undeserving positive reviews in some businesses in order to promote them or by giving false negative opinions to some other businesses in order to damage their reputations. We are providing two ways for achieving this objective, the Review Spike Detection (RSD) module and the User Rating Behaviour (URB) module.
